            <p>Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it Man, I hate this p Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it Man, I hate this part of down Romanticize a quiet life There's no place like my room But you had to go I know, I know, I know Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore Not even the burnouts are out here anymore And you had to go I know, I know, I know Out in the park, we watch the sunset Talking on a rusty swing set After a while you went quiet and I got mean I'm always pushing you away from me But you come back with gravity And when I call, you come home A bird in your teeth So I gotta go I know, I know, I know When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado I'm gonna chase it I know, I know, I know I gotta go now I know, I know, I know Driving out into the sun Let the ultraviolet cover me up Went looking for a creation myth Ended up with a pair of cracked lips Windows down, scream along To some America First rap, country song A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall Slot machines, fear of God Windows down, heater on Big bolts of lightning hanging low Over the coast, everyone's convinced It's a government drone or an alien spaceship Either way, we're not alone I'll find a new place to be from A haunted house with a picket fence To float around and ghost my friends No, I'm not afraid to disappear The billboard said, "The end is near" I turned around, there was nothing there Yeah, I guess the end is here The end is here The end is here The end is here The end is here Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it Man, I hate this part of Texas Close my eyes, fantasize Three clicks and I'm home When I get back I'll lay around Then I'll get up and lay back down Romanticize a quiet life There's no place like my room But you had to go I know, I know, I know Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore Not even the burnouts are out here anymore And you had to go I know, I know, I know Out in the park, we watch the sunset Talking on a rusty swing set After a while you went quiet and I got mean I'm always pushing you away from me But you come back with gravity And when I
